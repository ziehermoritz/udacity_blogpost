## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

Starting with the data of the 2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, I was interested if there is such thing as a age bias present in the answers.
The questions I tried to answer included:
1. Is there a noticeable home office spread among professional generations?
2. Which groups tendto share knowledge or answer more questions?
3. Opinions of age groups on blockchain, cryptocurrencies and decentralization?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

In this repository there are available 3 source files and the resulting figures of the code.
The code is provided by a jupyter notebook, where each questions is highlighted by a markdown cell. The notebook includes additional comments to describe my thoughts, but feel free to reach out!
In the data folder the datasets provided by Stack Overflow are included as csv-datafiles.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](asdfasdf).
